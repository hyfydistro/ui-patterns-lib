# Back To top

Note: Other techniques may be more appropriate on some sites.

When users get at the bottom of a really long page, they often need to get back to the top to:

* See the navigation menu and choose a new destination

* Access filtering and sorting features

 * Enter or edit a query in the search box

 When the page is really long (e.g. because of infinite scrolling), it becomes too tedious to scroll back up through screens and screens of content. Hence the role of the _Back to Top_ button.

## Guidelines for 'Back to Top' Buttons

1. Use a _Back to Top_ button for pages that are **longer than 4 screens**. For relatively short page lengths, _Back to Top_ links are overkill - people can simply scroll back without excessive effort. No need to clutter the interface if you can simply use the scrollbar or your finger to quickly navigate to the top.

2. Place a persistent _Back to Top_ button in the **lower right** side of the page. This is where people expect to see it. This position is out of the way, but noticeable. When the button is placed in a different place on the screen, it is often ignored.

3. **Label** the button _Back to Top_. This phrase is most descriptive. An icon only (e.g. an arrow pointing up) can be ambiguous and, depending on the graphical realization, may not convey the right meaning.

4. Have **one** sticky _Back to Top_ link per page instead of including multiple links in every section of the page. (This latter pattern used to be popular on pages with anchor links.) In usability studies, we observe people ignoring these repetitive links because they are so predictable.

5. Keep the button **small** so it doesn't cover important page elements. But, if you are on a touch screen, make it big enough so people can tap it.

6. Make the button **stand out visually** on the page rather than blend in. When _Back to Top_ blends too much with the background content, users are less like to notice and use it.

7. Consider **delaying the appearance** of a _Back to Top_ option until after users scroll a few pages AND indicate that they want to scroll up (e.g. move the scroll bar up, flick up on the page). Thus, the button appears only when it is most likely needed, without covering up important parts of the screen the rest of the times.

8. Make the button **stationary**. Once it appears, don't allow it to move. Moving elements cause major distractions, since the eye is automatically attracted to any movement on the screen.

9. Let users **control** scrolling. Never allow the page to scroll automatically, such as when new content becomes available at the top of the page. Better to provide a notification and allow users to make the decision on whether or not to scroll to see any new content.

## Alternatives to 'Back to Top'

* **Navigation at the bottom** : This approach works best when users tend to scroll to the very bottom of long pages on your site.

* **Sticky menus** : More elegant.

* **The Home Button on social sites** : Brings people to the top of their homepage, which happens to be a page with long feed and in most need of a quick method to back to the top; Don't count for other websites.
